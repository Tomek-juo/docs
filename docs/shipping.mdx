By default, Juo uses shipping rates defined by your currently active shipping profile in Shopify. If you’d like to use different rates for subscriptions, create a dedicated shipping profile.

Don’t add any products to this shipping profile. Reach out to Juo team once the rates are configured properly, and we will make sure that they are is applied to all subscription orders and renewals.

In the Merchant Portal, you can edit shipping rates for individual subscriptions. ![Screenshot 2025-03-06 at 16.59.53.png](https://cdn.juo.io/content-uploads/Screenshot_2025_03_06_at_16_59_53_d72fd02f4b.png)

More advanced shipping rules are possible. You can reward your subscribers with free shipping after X order using [Extras](https://juo.io/docs/extras). Subscription experiences like [Build-a-Box](https://juo.io/docs/adding-build-a-box) or [Custom Workflows](https://juo.io/docs/custom-workflows) also have their own Shipping settings.
