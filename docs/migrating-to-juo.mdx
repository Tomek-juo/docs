The following guide details the process of migrating subscribers from Recharge V1 or V2 to Juo Subscriptions. The migration is seamless and lossless, and it consists of the following steps:

1. Exporting all subscriptions from your old platform.
2. Cancelling existing subscriptions
3. Importing and enabling subscriptions in Juo

Juo team will handle the key steps of the migration process, but as a merchant, you have to follow certain steps to make sure the migration goes smoothly and is properly timed with launching Juo Subscriptions on your store.

Your customers will **not** be notified about the migration (unless you want to), nor they will have to take any steps like creating an account, to be able to continue to manage and receive their subscriptions.

## Step 1 — Install and set up Juo Subscriptions

In this step, you have to set up Juo on your store. Use our Getting Started guide to prepare for launching subscriptions with Juo and the migration.

1. First, [Install Juo Subscriptions](https://juo.io/docs/installing-the-app) from Shopify App Store.
2. [Recreate your existing selling plans in Juo](https://juo.io/docs/guides/creating-subscription-plan), and create new ones if you like.
3. Configure notifications, integrations, customer portal and other settings that you need to finalize the subscription experience.
4. Schedule the migration and launch date with Juo team. This is essential for the process to go smoothly.

## Step 2 — Launch Juo Subscriptions

1. A few days before the migration, create a draft of your current theme. Refrain from making any changes on your live theme during this time, as they could be lost when it’s replaced with the new one.
2. Remove the subscription widget of your existing provider from the draft theme.
3. Follow the steps to [set up Juo Subscription widget](https://juo.io/docs/guides/adding-juo-subscription-widget) on desired product templates.
4. [Add a link to Juo Customer Portal to your login page](https://juo.io/docs/guides/adding-manage-subscriptions-link) to give your customers an easy way to manage their subscriptions.
5. On the launch day, publish the draft theme.

From here on out, all subscriptions will be processed by Juo and we can move on to migrating the subscribers from your previous provider.

## Step 3 — Migration

In this step, create export of your existing subscriptions from your current provider or payment gateway. The step will be different depending on the provider, so contact us at [team@juo.io](mailto:team@juo.io) for assistance. If the platform doesn’t provide a way to export, contact us and our team can handle that via API.

Juo team will make sure that subscription management any notifications in our old platform are disabled during the course of the migration to make sure it processes smoothly.

## Step 4 — Finalization

1. From here on out, all your subscribers will be visible in Juo Merchant Portal.
2. The new subscription will immediately show up in Juo analytics, so you can start tracking them in one place.
3. You are free to uninstall your previous subscription app.
