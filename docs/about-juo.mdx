## What is Juo?

Juo is a powerful subscription toolkit designed to deliver an exceptional subscriber experience. With Juo, you can create and manage tailored subscription offers that seamlessly integrate with your storefront.

Juo enables multiple recurring purchase options:

- **Subscribe and Save** plans with progressive discounts
- **Curated boxes and workflows** (for auto SKU swaps, replenishment offers, or loyalty discounts)
- **Build-a-box** with custom layouts
- **Memberships:** Exclusive access and benefits
- **Personalized Upsells**: Enhance subscriptions with one-time offers.
- **Custom retention flows**: With different recovery strategies and analytics

## Finding the app

If you’re selling subscriptions or planning to start, you can find the Juo app on the Shopify App Store [here](https://apps.shopify.com/juo-subscriptions).

You can also access the Juo app from within your Shopify admin. On the “Apps” page, there’s a button at the top that will direct you to the Juo app.
